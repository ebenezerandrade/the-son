 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The main objective of this work was the construction of a security catalog for the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architectural Pattern, aiming at assisting Requirements Engineers and Software Engineers in specifying the requirements associated with the non-functional Security requirement. Using Softgoal Interdependecy Graphs of non-functional requirements, taking into account the good practices of Meta-Oriented Requirements Engineering. It was then modeled in the NFR Framework notation the Security Catalog, based mainly on the concepts of Security presented by Chung based on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, in addition the catalog supports the definition of Information Security defined in ISO 27001. And applied to the MVC architectural standard, where it is verified the relation of the flexible goals and operations with the layers of the MVC Architectural Pattern.
